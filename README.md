# A Light in the Dark
*A top down exploration game in a world of eternal night.*

A prototype I made in Construct 2 over the course of a few months to experiment with tilemaps and designing exploration and small puzzles. Decided to not continue with the game finally, but [you can play the demo here.](https://alcex.itch.io/a-light-in-the-dark-demo) If you're interested in the development process, you can read the devlog at [TIGSource.](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=62427)
